# Firebase-Based Chatbot Site Using Azure API

## Overview

This project is a Firebase-based web application that leverages Azure API to provide users with access to AI systems. The level of AI access is determined by the user's account permissions, ensuring that each user only interacts with AI models relevant to their specific tasks. This system enhances both security and customization, allowing for tailored AI solutions while maintaining strict access control.

## Features

- **Role-Based AI Access:** Users can only view and interact with AI models that are relevant to their assigned tasks, based on their account's permission level.
- **Customizable AI Systems:** The application supports dynamic AI model integration, allowing for easy updates and expansions tailored to specific user roles.
- **Secure Data Handling:** By restricting access to AI models, the system ensures that sensitive data and functionalities are protected.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Users receive real-time responses from AI models, improving efficiency and decision-making processes.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore
- **API Integration:** Azure API for AI model handling
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- Firebase CLI
- Azure account with API access

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Create a new project in Firebase Console.
   - Enable Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Hosting.
   - Update the Firebase configuration in your project:
     \`\`\`javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
     \`\`\`
   - Initialize Firebase:
     \`\`\`bash
     firebase init
     \`\`\`

4. **Azure API Integration:**
   - Set up your Azure API endpoint and obtain the API key.
   - Store your Azure API key in Firebase Functions as environment variables:
     \`\`\`bash
     firebase functions:config:set azure.key="YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY"
     \`\`\`

5. **Deploy to Firebase:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   \`\`\`

## Usage

- **Login:** Users can log in with their credentials. Depending on their permission level, different AI models will be available.
- **Interact with AI:** After logging in, users can select AI models relevant to their tasks and receive real-time feedback.
- **Admin Panel:** Administrators can manage user roles and permissions, as well as update AI models.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** The application ensures that AI models and user data are only accessible to authorized users.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are enforced at both the frontend and backend to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Audit Logs:** All interactions with AI models are logged for security and compliance purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Extend the platform to support multiple organizations with isolated data and AI models.
- **AI Model Management Dashboard:** Provide a user interface for admins to manage and update AI models directly from the application.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Integrate analytics to track AI usage and performance across different user roles.
